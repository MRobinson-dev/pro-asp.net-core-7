# Typos for *Pro ASP.NET Core 7*

This file contains smaller errors that are unlikely to prevent the code examples from working and which I will correct in the next edition of the book. See [this](errata.md) file for mistakes that prevent the code examples from working as expected.

**Chapter 4**

On page 60, the command used in listing 4.1 is deprecated. Use this command instead:

    dotnet new list

On page 63, this sentence:

>   Enter demo.html in the Name field, click the Add button to create the new file, and replace the contents with the element shown in listing 4.3. 

should be:

> Enter demo.html in the Name field, click the Add button to create the new file, and 
replace the contents with the **elements** shown in listing 4.3.
